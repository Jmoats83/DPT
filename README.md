# Distinction–Persistence Theory (DPT)

**Distinction–Persistence Theory (DPT)** is a domain-agnostic framework for identifying real events by detecting structured, persistent residue after subtracting the best smooth model of a signal.

## Core Claim

After removing the best smooth explanation, reality-relevant events are those whose residuals retain coherent structure beyond noise.

## Signal Decomposition

Let an observed signal be:

x(t) = m(t) + r(t)

where:
- x(t) is the observed signal
- m(t) is the best smooth model (expectation)
- r(t) is the residual

A distinction occurs when r(t) departs significantly from zero.  
A persistent distinction occurs when that departure leaves ordered residue across time or scale.

## DPT Score

Λ̂(t) = Q(t) · (1 − H_spec(t)) · (1 − Tail_frac(t)) · (1 − E_str(t))

with Λ̂(t) ∈ [0,1].

High values indicate strong, non-noise-like, unsmeared, structurally coherent residuals.
